    <h1>Data Structures & Algorithms</h1>

    <p><strong>Data Structure: </strong>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. Examples are arrays,queue,stack,graph</p>

    <p><strong>Array:</strong> Array is a linear data structure where all elements are arranged sequentially.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Stack:</strong> is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Queue:</strong> A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, similar to a line of people waiting for a service.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Linked List:</strong> A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in different memory locations. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Graph:</strong> A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent networks such as social connections, transportation routes, and communication systems.</p>

    <p><strong> Algorithm: </strong> is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Examples are search and sort algorithms</p>

    <p><strong>Searching Algorithm :</strong>Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to locate specific items within a collection of data</p>

    <p><strong>Sorting</strong> refers to rearrangement of a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.</p>
